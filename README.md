# GameTwist Platform - QA Assignment

## üîß Assignment Task Summary

This project is a QA assignment for testing the **Login** and **Registration** functionalities of the [GameTwist](https://www.gametwist.com/en/) platform.

It includes:

- Manual Test Case Documentation
- Test Automation Recommendations
- C# API Test Automation for Swagger Petstore
- Reqnroll automation structure

---

##  Assignment Requirements

### 1. Manual Test Scenarios (Login & Registration)

- Developed 15 test cases using **Gherkin syntax** for clarity.
- Focused on both functional and validation scenarios.
- All test cases include:
  - Title
  - Preconditions
  - Test Description
  - Expected Results
  - Priority
  - Automation Decision

### 2. Automation Feasibility

####  **Test Cases Recommended for Automation**
- Login form display
- Successful/unsuccessful login
- 'Remember Me' checkbox functionality
- Registration with valid/invalid inputs
- Field-level validations
- Duplicate email check
- Password strength check

These tests are stable, repeatable, and critical for release confidence. Automating them using **C# and Selenium** ensures fast regression feedback (to be done in the future)

####  **Test Cases NOT Recommended for Automation**
- Email confirmation delivery
- Email link behavior
- IP-based geolocation redirect

These require external systems, network variability, or email inbox access. Best tested manually or via 3rd-party tools.

---

##  API Automation Task

Automated 4 endpoints from [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io):

- `POST /pet`
- `GET /pet/{petId}`
- `PUT /pet`
- `DELETE /pet/{petId}`
- `Post /pet` with malformed URL

###  Assertions
- Verified status codes 200 for all of them except the malformed url 400 and 404 for the Get request after deletion
- Validated that the `GET` response matches the `POST` request body
- C# implementation with `RestSharp` and `NUnit` and `Reqnroll`

---

##  Technologies Used

- Language: **C#**
- API Testing: **RestSharp**, **NUnit** **Reqnroll**
- Manual Testing: **Gherkin**, **Markdown**
